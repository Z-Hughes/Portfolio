  "description": "Simple minimalistic site created for my development portfolio. As a base I used Strata from html5up because it contained a few elements that are beyond my current scope of development tools (i.e. parallax background effect, Poptrox-powered lightbox gallery) as well as Sass sources.  I thought this would be a great opurtunity for me to play around with these elements to further my knowledge as well as futher my experience reading,  understanding and enhancing previoiusly written code.",
